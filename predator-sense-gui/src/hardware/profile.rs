// (see fan_mode_for() below) matches the physical Predator/Turbo key, but some
// users would rather keep the automatic fan curve even at those power
// targets and accept a louder/hotter machine only if the curve itself
// decides that's needed. Opt-in, default off - keeps the existing
// safety-first behavior for everyone who doesn't touch the new setting.
//
// The in-memory mirror of the setting this module used to keep is gone: since
// fan behaviour is decided by `config::fan_plans` rather than by set_profile,
// the only reader is `fan::migrate_plans`, which already has the whole
// AppConfig in hand. A second copy could only drift from it.

// Issue #57 (dathide): some users run a separate CPU tuning tool (e.g.
// `tuned` with a custom profile) that writes the exact same sysfs files a
// profile switch does here (scaling_governor, energy_performance_preference,
// intel_pstate/no_turbo, intel_pstate/min_perf_pct) - whichever tool writes
// last wins, so the two fight every time either one applies a change. On by
// default (preserves existing behavior); turning it off leaves CPU governor/
// EPP/turbo/min_perf entirely to whatever else is managing them, while every
// other effect of a profile switch (firmware thermal profile, fan mode, GPU
// wattage) keeps working exactly as before.
