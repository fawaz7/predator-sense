//! Chassis light bar on the PH16-71 generation, over the firmware's WMI
//! lighting method (`WMBH` method 20, the same method the keyboard backlight
//! used on older WMI-keyboard models) through facer's `/dev/acer-gkbbl-0`.
//!
//! The 16-byte frame is the one `AcerECLightbarController.dll` sends
//! (reverse-engineered and hardware-confirmed on a PH16-71 by
//! github.com/Exyons/Venator, `kernel/venator-gaming.c`):
//!
//! ```text
//! 0 mode  1 speed  2 brightness  3 0x00  4 direction  5 R  6 G  7 B
//! 8 0x03  9 0x02 (target: light bar - 0x01 is the keyboard)  10..15 0x00
//! ```
//!
//! Byte 9 is what kept the bar dark from the keyboard page: every WMI
//! keyboard write carries `0x01` there, so it addresses the keyboard channel
//! even on a chassis whose keyboard is USB. The firmware's mode IDs are
//! sparse: `0x00..0x07` are effects, `0xFF` is solid colour ("Direct" in the
//! OpenRGB SDK captures shipped with Order52/ph16-71-rgb), everything in
//! between is a silent no-op.
