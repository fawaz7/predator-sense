//! There is no event for this that a plain GTK application receives, so this
//! uses the same test the hotkey daemon does (`installer/src/hotkey.rs`):
//! `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` counts time spent suspended and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` does
//! not, so the gap between them only ever grows, and it grows by exactly the
//! time the machine was asleep. Sampling that gap on a timer turns "we were
//! suspended" into an ordinary poll.

//! Deliberately not a logind/D-Bus subscription: this has to work the same way
//! whether the session is GNOME, KDE or a bare compositor, and the drift test
//! has no dependencies at all.
