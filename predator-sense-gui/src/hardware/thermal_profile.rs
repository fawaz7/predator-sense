//! Raw firmware thermal profiles, ranked by the power they actually deliver.
//!
//! The types, the ranking rules and the file location live in
//! `predator-sense-protocol` because the hotkey daemon and the privileged
//! helper read the same calibration; this module is the GUI's side of it - the
//! sysfs and RAPL I/O, and the probe that produces a calibration in the first
//! place.
//!
//! Why measure at all: `platform_profile` only exposes the modes the kernel
//! driver knows how to name, and on at least one firmware (Predator PHN16-73,
//! Arrow Lake) that naming does not follow the power order - the mode the
//! driver calls `low-power` is the second *strongest*, and the firmware's
//! strongest and weakest modes have no name, so they cannot be reached through
//! it at all. Hard-coding a corrected table would only move the problem to the
//! next firmware, so this probes each index the firmware advertises and ranks
//! by the package power limit that results.
//!
//! Nothing here runs on its own: calibration switches profiles, which the user
//! can feel, so it only ever starts when explicitly requested.
